Creating a Linear Regression model to predict bike sales

# Problem Statement

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

 - Which variable are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes

 - How well those variables describe the bike demands


# Business Goal

Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary withÂ different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
